    <p class="lead">This Laravel 10 - Vue 3 app was created by <a href="https://aaweb.tech" target="_blank">https://aaweb.tech</a></p>
    <p class="lead">
        It's a relatively simple app but don't underestimate it. A lot is happening under the hood. :) Its main focus is to show the Laravel / Vue combo in action. Quotes are created by API built with Laravel and shown in the UI via Vue 3. Vue interacts with the API to get / create / update / delete quotes.
